# Management, Access, and Use of Big Data

This course discussed principles and technologies to capture, clean, contextualize, store, access, and use data. 
It covered the follwing main areas:

* Data pipelines in business and science   
* Distributed systems   
* SQL, noSQL, and graph databases   
* Concepts in metadata and data provenance    
* Concepts in data trust and its role in reuse
