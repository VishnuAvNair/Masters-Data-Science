# Data Science in Practice 

In the Summer of 2017 I joined the IU Bloomington [Data Science Consulting Club](https://github.com/csathler/Masters-Data-Science/blob/master/Data-Science-Project-Club/DSCI%20D590_Data%20Science%20in%20Practice_ONL.PDF) for exposure to real work projects as Independent Study class.  I had the opportunity to contribute in two as a Data Scientist and Project Manager.  Due to NDAs signed at the time little can be disclosed beyond what is included below: 

## Company A (startup)

* Developed data cleansing routine to prepare email text dataset for classification problem. 
* Developed ML solution using scikit-learn to classify dataset across 10 categories, 9 of which comprised 98% of the data.

## Company B (food industry)

* Built components of data pipeline to download online data from public web site (web scraping) for data mining
* Created documentation to support the project
