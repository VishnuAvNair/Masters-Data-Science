# Data Science Project Club

In the Summer of 2017 I joined the IU Bloomington [Data Science Consulting Club], or Project Club, for Independent Study credit.  I had the opportunity to contribute in two as a Data Scientist and Project Manager.  Due to NDAs signed at the time little can be disclosed beyond what is included below: 

## Company A (startup)

* Developed ML solution using scikit-learn to classify dataset across 10 categories, 9 of which comprised 98% of the data.
