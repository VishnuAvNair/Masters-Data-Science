# Nonparametrics and regression 

This course offered a survey of statistical methods that do not rely on parametric assumptions. The course started with a discussion of parametric techniques learned in typical introductory courses, and compared them to nonparametric alternatives to see when one technique outperforms another.

## Syllabus

* EDA and review of parametric stats         
* Nonparametric tests      
* Empirical distributions and the bootstrap       
* Multiple linear regression      
* Nonparametric and penalized regression      
* GLMs and other advanced models

## Assignments and projects

The class had six homework assignments and three short projects.  I selected 4 assignments and 2 project problems to showcase the work done in the course.  I received full credit or close to it in these selected assignments.
